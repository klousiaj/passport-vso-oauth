# Passport-Vso-OAuth

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategies for authenticating with 
[VSO](http://www.visualstudio.com/) using OAuth 2.0.

This module lets you authenticate using VSO in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, VSO authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

This library is built as an extension to the passport-oauth library 
from [Jared Hanson](https://github.com/jaredhanson)
and borrows liberally from the [Google Strategy](http://www.github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth). 

## Install

    $ npm install passport-vso-oauth
